Data aggregation is an important task on databases in order to represent a data using 
few numbers(total, average, etc.). Awk can be use for such aggregating techniques especially in 
structured data like csv files.

Task : Given the data in "employment.csv" you have to find sum of all entries in "Values" 
and append it to the end of the file("Net : <sum>") and sum for each distinct entry in "High_industry"
in the format ("entry_name : <sum>").
Separate the abovea above from the original records using 5 '='. See the below example
(After printing "Net : <value>", all other entries should be in lexicographical order)

Eg : 
Input -> 
Week_end,Indicator,High_industry,Value
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Film,2090110
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Agriculture,95150
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Banking,405050
...

Output -> 
Week_end,Indicator,High_industry,Value
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Film,2090110
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Agriculture,95150
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Banking,405050
...
