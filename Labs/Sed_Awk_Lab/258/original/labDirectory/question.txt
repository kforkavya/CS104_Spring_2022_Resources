After quickly finishing your C++ script you realize that instead of "pprint"(the function that you have defined) 
you have written "printf" to yield strings to the standard output(terminal). Seems like you were not using 
good IDE(seed for following labs) and cannot just find and replace all instances of "printf" with "pprint". 

Task : Given the file test.cpp, you need to replace all instances of "printf" to "pprint".
You need to ensure that ONLY those instances of "printf" are replaced where it is used a function.

Eg : 
Input -> 
printf("eren");
otherprintf("mikasa");

Output -> 
pprint("eren");
otherprintf("mikasa");   // printf in substring is not changed

Note : You need to take filename as argument to bash script

Usage : 
sed -r -f var_change.sed <filename> > output.txt
