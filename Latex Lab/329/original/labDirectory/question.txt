For this activity, you are required to replicate the given pdf "assignment.pdf".
You have to fill up the "main.tex" and "references.bib" file, which can generate a pdf as close as possible to "assignment.pdf".
Below is the detailed description of the document you need to create. Read all the instructions before you begin with the activity.

All the packages required for this activity are already imported in the given "main.tex" file. You shouldn't and mustn't import any other packages. 

Following are the major components in each part of the document, which would be considered for evaluation:

1) Preamble
  -> Title
  -> Author's name
  -> Table of contents

2) Section 1 : Introduction
  -> List of topics

3) Section 2 : Transformation of Random Variable 
  -> Three mathematical equations (extra weightage for the last one)
  -> 1 Footnote
  -> 1 Citation

4) Section 3 : Multi-variate Gaussian Distribution
  -> 3 subsections
  -> 2 Citations
  -> Subfigures
  -> Table
  -> Equation 2 (last equation)

5) Headers and Footers for each page (except first one)
  -> Left header : "Transformation of R.V. and Multivariate Gaussian"
  -> Right header : "<Your name>"
  -> Footer : Page number

6) References for all the citations (there are 3 citations)

-> Cross-referencing (references to tables, figures or other sections) : https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Labels_and_Cross-referencing 
-> For citations and references at the end, add 3 references(any) in "references.bib" file. Cite them at the places given in "assignment.pdf"


For equations without numbers (like the first 3 equations of section 1), use display math mode : \[ ... \]
For equation with numbers (like the last equation on section 1), use the "equation" environment : \begin{equation} ... \end{equation}

For any component of the document, refer to the resources given above BEFORE finding other solutions available online.


Usage : 
pdflatex main
bibtex main
pdflatex main
pdflatex main


Grading details : Your submission will graded on the basis of the certain tags in the "main.tex" file and "references.bib", though 
it must generate a pdf without any errors, warnings are acceptable.
Hence, in most cases exact match between your rendered pdf and "assignment.pdf" is not considered, yet it is advisable to create your pdf as similar as possible to the given "assignment.pdf".
