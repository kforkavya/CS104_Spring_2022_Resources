************Problem Statement*************

Now we will be looking at how to use formulae in calculating few statistical data.

In the excel named "Marks.xlsx",Column A contains roll numbers, followed by marks till column F for various exams in course CS 104.

Column B to F contains marks of Project(Max marks : 50), Safe Quiz - 1 (Max marks : 20), Mid sem(Max marks : 30),Safe Quiz -2(Max marks : 20),End sem(Max marks : 30)

Below is the Evaluation Plan : 
SAFE quizzes (Objective ,2) 20% [ Safe quiz-1 10%, Safe quiz-2 10%]
Proctored Lab Exams (Hands-on, 2) 60% [Mid - 30%, End sem - 30%]
Project (documentation, code quality,demo, viva) 20%
Total 100%


In Column G, you need to fill the total Score of the respective student corresponding to column A.Maximum marks that can be achievable is 100.
You need to scale the marks of each exam according to the weightage it carries. 
For example, In Project, student 23B00030 received 30 marks / 50.  The weightage of project is 20% i.e., 20 marks. 
So, their project marks counting for total score will be 30 * (20/50) = 12 marks.


In Column H, you need to fill respective grade obtained as the rules mentioned below

        >=85% -> A 
>=75% & < 85% -> B
>=65% & < 75% -> C
>=55% & < 65% -> D
>=45% & < 55% -> E
        < 45% -> F

Number of students are 100 ie. 23B00001 to 23B00100

In column J, You need to fill the values of the metrics asked in Column I in the respective row
The metrics required are Average (rounded to 2 decimal places), max, min, mode, median  of Total marks of students and count of failed students (Who got F grade).
