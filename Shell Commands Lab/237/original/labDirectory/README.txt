------------------- Lab 01 (Unix) - Advanced Unix ------------------

This activity is to get you accustomed to additional Unix commands.

Steps:
1. Go through and try out (via the command line) the commands listed
in the other text file (commands.txt) present in the lab directory.
2. You can use the sample files in the student-files folder.
3. For executing the hello.c program, run "./commands.sh" from
within the student-files directory.
4. Attempt the SAFE quiz for unix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aside: You may notice that some sample files have no extension.
This is allowed in Unix, because for Unix, "everything is a file".
